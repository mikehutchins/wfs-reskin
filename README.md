###What first?###
Clone - Pull - f5

### This is a spa template  and a responsive layout ###
I've broken the sections out in cshtml as an example.  

You may also link to real cshtml files as you need (see the sign up and sign in in the home).

### Contains the Template, Modifications, MVC-ization of layout and views. ###

I've let tons of the features of this template in tact as examples.

If you want to make css mods they are in css/styles.less (you'll need web essentials [vs]) don't change the css or it'll get overwritten.

### My costs and so on ###

*** I will invoice but here's the rough breakdown:

I know you're on a budget, my old hourly rate = 75$ * 4.5 hours = 337.5$

My purchases:

Stock photography: $40 (part of my $50 plan) I'll check in the originals in the solution

Font (needed to doctor the logo to make it fit, didn't have the font) $35

Template $15 from wrapboostrap (the template is in this repo.
